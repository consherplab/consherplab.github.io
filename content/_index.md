The Conservation Herpetology Lab (ConsHerpLab) generates scientific evidence to guide the conservation of reptiles and amphibians. We focus on filling critical knowledge gaps by combining field studies, experiments, genomics, and ecological modeling. Our projects span from grassland viper thermal adaptation, grazing impacts, and wetland reconstruction to invasive species, predator control, and long-term monitoring. By linking research with practical conservation challenges, we provide the data and tools needed to protect vulnerable species and habitats in a rapidly changing world.
